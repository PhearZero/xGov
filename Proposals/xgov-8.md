## Abstract
Over the last 6 months, Evil Tools have developed a slew of no-code tools to carry out monotonous processes on the Algorand Blockchain and allowing users with no coding experience to work efficiently and easily.
To Date, we have developed Mass Mint Tools for ARC3, ARC19, ARC69, Mass Updater tools for ARC19 and ARC69, Mass Asset Add, Mass Send, Mass Asset Opt Out, IPFS Collection Upload, wallet holding tools, and tools that allow people to find
holders of collections and multimint assets.

We hope to continue to add more mass tools like Mass Freeze, Mass Clawback, Mass Asset Destroy, while also improving the UI/UX we already have built. 

We have also made the decision to Open Source the Tools once we integrate everything. 

## Team
LoafPickle - Project Manager. I have 10 years of Project Management experience working in NYC on large scale construction projects. In addition, I am a long timer in the Algorand NFT Space and have been helping develop utility 
projects on the chain since May 2021. I am currently the Head of Strategy and Community for Thurstober Digital Studios.
ByKewel - Tool Developer. Kewel is another Algorand NFT long timer that was the first to create wallet holding, sales, and listing discord bots that projects were able to incorporate into the ecosysytem. They also built the first
on-chain DAO tool back in February 2022. 
Jenna (thurstober) - Project Lead.

## Experience with Algorand
All of us have been in the Algorand NFT Space since May 2021. Thurstober Digital Studios has built a full horse racing utiltiy series and our body of work with Evil Tools speaks for itself.

## Roadmap
Brrrrrrr Mode: - This is built. renamed to infinity mode.

A way for users to get away from the Pera limitations of only being able to sign 64 tx at a time.

The site does not store any information. We would have a means for a creator to enter their keys and connect right to the SDK.

With the inclusion of rekey tech, creators can rekey to a burner wallet and use that to enter the seed of the burner, then rekey back to their private keys. For the Airdrop tool, an escrow wallet could be used. I would write out guides and warnings so people feel their comfiest, but they can always sign through Pera if they feel uncomfortable.

I recently minted a 2270 series for a creator and having to sign so many times made me want to lose my mind, especially being spoiled my myalgo's 1024 max cap. With Series sizes in the thousands and airdrops going to hundreds of wallets, the tools are meant to be able to scale infinitely and it feels lame having such a hinderance.

Heavy NFT users typically have more than 64 assets at a time so if you wanted to send 256 assets to another wallet, you would need to sign 12 times to add, send, and opt out of the asset compared to just 3.

Arc19 Collection Information: - This is built
Pulls the on chain metadata for ARC19 Series so Creators can easily update and re-upload.

Mass Asset Destroy: - This is built
Destroys creator made assets.

Premium Send: - This is built
Allows users to customize the note for their airdrops.

Asset Opt In Check: - This is built
Add the ability to see wallets who have opted into an ASA to our existing multi-mint holder tool.

Premium Multi-mint Holder Check: - This is built
Add NFD support filters to check if people who are holding/opted in have an NFD and verified socials to reduce farmers.

Simple Mass Opt-in/out, Mass Send, and Mass Destroy:
Create a mobile friendly layout that uses text boxes over CSV.

Mass Clawback:
Allows creators to clawback assets in bulk.

Mass Freeze: 
Allows creators to freeze assets in bulk.

API:
Allows devs to tap into the tools we already built more efficiently. 

## Benefits for the community
The benefits are already being realized. When the myalgo hack went down, we quickly created mass add and send tools with Pera integration so creators and collectors alike were able to efficiently move their assets to safe homes. 
Since then, we have creators thanking us for providing them the tools we wish we had back in the early days of Algorand NFTs.

## Additional information
In addition to the tooling, we also provide creator guides that allow new creators to get a lay of the ecosystem to help the onboarding experience. You can find them here: https://medium.com/@loafpickle
